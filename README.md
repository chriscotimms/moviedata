# MovieData Project
This project was produced for the Founders and Coders application in Spring 2023. The brief was to work with an array of objects of objects, and to develop code that parses this information in a way that allows the movies to be sorted through various parameters, such as "rating", "runtime", and "year".

I started my application a bit too late to realistically apply for the previous deadline, but I had already developed a comment box project which had been a requirement for the application at that time. This time the application had evolved and dropped that requirement, so instead of casting out that work I decided to incorporate it as the interactive element, which was an additional requirement of the moviedata project. 

I've tried to keep the maintain accessibility by using buttons to hide and display information and comments, which instead of mouseenter and mouseover, have built in tab focus and enter-key access. 

I've alos tried to tidy up some of the code since completing the final two projects. Some of this was necessary to implement some aesthetic changes, but also am trying to practice using anonymous functions and arrow functions as much as possible. When I orginally built this project I was heavily dependant on using ID at every node stage, so i have tried to  address this by using Classes more confidently when I can, and using e.target to navigate within more anonymous functions.
